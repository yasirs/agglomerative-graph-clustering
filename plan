plan for program for link prediction measurement

1. read all edges
2. randomly select p% of n edges by storing numbers in a set
3. write remaining edges in a file
4. write withheld edges in a separate file (gold positive)
5. run agglo, and write all non-edge scores
6. do so for susequent residuals
7. compute other scores for all non-edges
	jaccard coefficient
	degree product
	common neighbors
	shortest neighbors?
